Natural Intelligence for .NET - by Garry Passarella

Some code I wrote to familiarize myself with some of the techniques being used in AI research. This library currently has support for single and multi-layer perceptrons and a GA. I have decided to share this with the community.

Welcome contributions and additions to the solution. Would like to include Kohonen networks, PSO and ACO in the future.
